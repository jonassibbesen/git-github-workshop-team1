# git-github-workshop-team1

This repository is used for the HeaDS git and GitHub workshop 2022 (team 1). Workshop participants should clone the repository after which they can use it to complete the last workshop exercise. The shared repository is made for hosting cooking recipes which are made locally by participants and then pushed to remote for everyone to view.
